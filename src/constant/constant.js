        candidateName: 'Akshay Borkade',
        storyContent: `Today, I was profoundly touched by our team member Akshay Borkade, who has faced significant challenges after losing the use of both legs due to polio. Rather than seeking sympathy, Akshay strives to live a meaningful life filled with happiness.

Recently, Akshay faced difficulties that prevented him from bringing his lunch. Instead of asking for help, he quietly fasted. When our team discovered this, my wife Snehal stepped in as a caring guide, ensuring Akshay felt included and supported.

Since joining BVG Internship, Akshay has said, “All my regrets have gone away.” In just 15 days, he has found the courage to embrace life on his own terms, despite the challenges. He now has a team, new friends, and a space where he can truly be himself.

Witnessing Akshay’s smile and growth has renewed my sense of purpose, reminding me of our mission to create 1 million jobs for people with physical challenges. These individuals are not disabled; they are talented and ready for opportunities.

This journey is not just about business; it’s about making a difference. I invite you to join us in creating a world where everyone has the chance to live, work, and grow together.

Let’s walk this journey together, supporting individuals like Akshay in their path to success.`,
